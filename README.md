# Labs for CSC325 course (Artificial Intelligence) at Swansea University

## Repository Structure:
* Python files contain the solutions for the lab
* PDF files contain the labs specifications

## Labs for Part 1 of the course:
* Lab 1 involves using BFS or DFS to find solutions for the 24 game
* Lab 2 involves using Greedy and A* Algorithms to find solutions for the 8 game (Informed Search using Heursitic Funtion)
* Lab 3 involves using Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm to solve the 8 Queens Puzzle

## Progress So Far:
* Completed Lab 1 100%
* Completed Lab 2 100% -> The algorithm gets stuck at a certain nodes, will need to be fixed later
